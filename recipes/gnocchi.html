        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Gnocchi with lamb ragout</strong> is a comforting and rich dish that blends tender, pillowy gnocchi with a savory, 
            slow-cooked lamb ragout. The gnocchi, made from soft potatoes, provides a light, fluffy texture that perfectly soaks 
            up the rich flavors of the ragout. The lamb, cooked until melt-in-your-mouth tender, is simmered with tomatoes, herbs, 
            and a touch of red wine, creating a hearty, flavorful sauce. The combination of the delicate gnocchi and the robust 
            ragout creates a satisfying, comforting meal, ideal for cozy evenings or special occasions.</p>
