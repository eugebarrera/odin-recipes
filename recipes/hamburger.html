        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>A fresh hamburger</strong> is a classic, satisfying dish that never fails to deliver. The star of the meal 
            is a juicy, perfectly grilled beef patty, tender and packed with flavor. It's served in a soft, lightly toasted bun 
            that adds just the right amount of warmth and texture. Every bite is a delightful combination of savory beef, warmth 
            from the freshly cooked patty, and the comforting softness of the bun. Whether served with a variety of toppings or 
            enjoyed on its own, a fresh hamburger offers a simple yet indulgent eating experience that's perfect for any occasion, 
            from casual weeknight dinners to weekend BBQs with friends.</p>
