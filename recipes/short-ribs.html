        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Short ribs with chimichurri</strong> is a flavorful and indulgent dish that pairs succulent, tender beef short
        ribs with a vibrant, tangy chimichurri sauce. The short ribs are slow-cooked or grilled to perfection, becoming
        melt-in-your-mouth tender, while the chimichurri adds a refreshing, zesty contrast. The rich, hearty flavor of the beef
        is beautifully complemented by the herbaceous and slightly tangy sauce, creating a perfect balance of flavors.
        This dish offers a satisfying and unforgettable dining experience, making it ideal for both casual meals and special occasions.</p>
